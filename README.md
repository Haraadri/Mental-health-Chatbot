# MentalhealthChatbot

This is my project for class Natural Language Processing

My specific goals encompass the development of a Chatbot capable of understanding and responding to mental health queries. 
The appliction of Rudra extends to providing users with accurate information, resources, and emotional support in a conversational manner. 
The project aims to cater to a diverse range of mental health-related queries, promoting self-help and awareness. 
The application of this Chatbot is versatile, potentially serving as a supplement to traditional mental health services, especially for individuals who may be more comfortable engaging with technology.
